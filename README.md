## FAQs

- **Hmm. What's this?**

This is the Repo Finder Bot, a bot designed to help people find good GitHub repositories to contribute to.

- **How does it work?**

Simple. Whenever you execute the `rf.repo [topic]` command in your server, the bot uses the GitHub API to find a good repository matching the topic and then send an array of details related to it.

- **What sort of details?**

A whole array of details, including basic info ranging from the amount of stars and forks to the latest issues contributed to the repo.

Here's an example:

- **Why are there no slash commands?**

There was a slight trouble trying to fetch data using slash commands but don't worry, slash commands will be added soon!

- **Why is the code so bad?**

It works.

I'll fix it.
